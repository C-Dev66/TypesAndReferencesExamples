# TypesAndReferencesExamples
// This is a console application that goes over the different Types &amp; References C# has to offer. Refer to the code for further explanation and discussion.

// There are value types for variables that hold different sizes of numbers. The biggest numbers should be of type long and the smallest ones (up to 255) can be declared as bytes.

// Every value type has a size, and you can’t put a value of a bigger type into a smaller variable, no matter what the actual size of the data is.

// When you’re using literal values, use the F suffix to indicate a float (15.6F) and M for a decimal (36.12M).

// Use the decimal type for money and currency. Floating-point precision is…well, it’s a little weird.

// There are a few types that C# knows how to convert automatically (an implicit conversion), like short to int, int to double, or float to double.

// When the compiler won’t let you set a variable equal to a value of a different type, that’s when you need to cast it. To cast a value (an explicit conversion) to another type, put the target type in parentheses in front of the value.

// There are some keywords that are reserved by the language and you can’t name your variables with them. They’re words (like for, while, using, new, and others) that do specific things in the language.

// A parameter is what you define in your method. An argument is what you pass to it.

// When you build your code in the IDE, it uses the C# compiler to turn it into an executable program.

// You can use methods on the static Convert class to convert values between different types.
